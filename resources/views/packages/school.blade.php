                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        “Dreamers Club” at schools is conducted similar to other outsourced school clubs such as music, taekwondo, among others. It targets lower and upper primary pupils as well as secondary school students, depending on the school. <br>
                        If your school would like to enrich its students’ lives by giving them life skills in money management, investments and entrepreneurship, feel free to contact us. For schools that already have an entrepreneurship program and would like to add money management, investments or both, feel free to contact us.
